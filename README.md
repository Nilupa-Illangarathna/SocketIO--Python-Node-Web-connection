SocketIO--Python-Node-Web-connection

This project demonstrates socket communication using Python, JavaScript, and Express. The code includes a Python script to send a state change to a server using Socket.IO, an HTML file to visualize the state change in a web interface, and a Node.js server to handle the socket connections.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ````
2. Install Node.js dependencies:

````
    npm install
    Install Python dependencies:
````
````
pip install requirements.txt
Start the Node.js server:
````

````
node server.js
The server will be running on http://localhost:3000.
````

Run the Python script to send a state change:

````
python client.py
````
The Python script uses the socketio library to connect to the server and emit a 'stateChange' event with a specified state.

Open the web interface in your browser:

Open http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to see the real-time state change visualization.

## Project Structure
- client.py: Python script for sending state changes to the server.
- index.html: HTML file for the web interface visualization.
- server.js: Node.js server handling socket connections.
- styles.css: CSS styles for the HTML visualization.
## Web Visualization
The HTML file (index.html) includes a simple web interface with a circle representing the state. The color of the circle changes based on the received state, providing a visual indication of the system's status.
